\section{PURPOSE}

This Style Guide is intended to help authors of \Planck-related papers prepare
high-quality manuscripts in a uniform style. It supplements the instructions
to authors provided by the  Astronomy \& Astrophysics Author's guide 

\url{http://www.aanda.org/doc_journal/instructions/aa_instructions.pdf}.

\noindent A\&A also has a useful English usage guide, available at 

\url{http://www.aanda.org/doc_journal/instructions/aa_english_guide.pdf}.

\noindent Both can be found under ``Author Information'' at
\url{http://www.aanda.org/}.


\section{\TeX\ STUFF}

The A\&A format is implemented in the A\&A document class file |aa.cls|,
available from 

\url{http://www.aanda.org/}

\noindent and from the \Planck\ SVN at

\url{https://scisvn01.esac.esa.int/Planck_Publication_Management}

\noindent In the 2013 papers, we used \verb|aa.cls v7.0|.  A\&A is now up to
\verb|v8.2|, although \verb|v7.0| is still allowed by A\&A.  Most of the differences between \verb|v7.0| and \verb|v8.2|
need no comment here, but there are three compatibility issues of note.

The ``structured'' abstract that was the default in \verb|v7.0| no longer
exists in \verb|v8.0|, eliminating the need for the \verb|[traditabstract]| option in
the \verb|\document{aa}| command at the beginning of the La\TeX\ file.  

The 2013 version of the \verb|Planck.tex| file (see below) is not compatible
with \verb|aa.cls v8.2|.  Make sure to use the current version of \verb|Planck.tex|,
always available at

\url{https://scisvn01.esac.esa.int/Planck_Publication_Management}

Up until September 2014, \Planck\ author lists were generated
with ``\verb|\\ \and|'' between institution names.  With \verb|aa.cls v7.0|, the
resulting double space between institution names at the end of \Planck\ papers
could be fixed by putting \verb|\raggedright| immediately before \verb|\end{document}|.
This kludge no longer works with \verb|aa.cls v8.2|.  Author lists are now generated
with ``\verb|\goodbreak \and|'' between institutions.  No \verb|\raggedright| is
required.  This is still a kludge to deal with a problem that A\&A should fix
in \verb|aa.cls|, but it works until they do.  

\medskip

Unfortunately, \verb|aa.cls v8.2| puts
long lists of institutions (the kind \Planck\ papers always have!) immediately
following the references, and before the appendices (if any).  This is weird,
to put it politely, and we are trying to get it changed.  {\bf Until we do, however, it is best to use aa.cls v7.0.  (Specify ``traditabstract,'' of course.
The institution list fix is backwards compatible.)}
